- 👋 Hi, I’m @kelmo974 - or Kellen IRL
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in: Uncovering the mechanisms and greater trends that shape the world in various categories. For non-job-related EDA, I tend to gravitate toward
- subjects in the realms of sports (especially biking and soccer), social sciences, climate change, and gastronomy. I'm always open to being introduced to fresh and 
- exciting themes to be explored employing analytical methods.

      
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge on a slew of data science applications from new libraries/modules in Python and JS, intermediate website and app design, and enterprise cloud
- services - a large portion of my current professional role. At work, it's largely Azure and Oracle based, but I have also been exposed to Big Query and AWS. I am currently
- working on an AWS analyitcs project in my spare time that has helped me become familiar with setting up and using S3 buckets, bridging connections to PostgreSQL, and tying it all together
- with Spark.
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a wide variety of projects. I'd be keenly interested in any sort of EDA leading to visualizations that raise awareness to protect
- nature - even cooler if it pertains to Appalachian culture or ecosystems. As an avid mountain biker, I'm always drawn to Strava data and its geographic representations
- of user activities.
